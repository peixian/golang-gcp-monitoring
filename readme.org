* Google Cloud Platform Monitoring API - Golang Example
  __THIS WILL PROBABLY CHARGE ($$$) YOUR GOOGLE ACCOUNT IF YOU RUN IT A BUNCH, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT__

  An example of the usage of the golang GCP monitoring API, meant to show a real example of it's usage rather than Google's examples, which are far too simple.

** Info
   The code runs through the provided project and lists all available metrics, then calls to get 3 GCP compute CPU metrics in parallel, using a ~sync.WaitGroup~ to wait on the goroutines. 

** Usage
   Clone, go build, and run with: 
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     golang-gcp-monitoring --service-account=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --project-id=<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   #+END_SRC
   
   or

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     go get -u github.com/peixian/golang-gcp-monitoring
     golang-gcp-monitoring --service-account=<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --project-id=<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
   #+END_SRC
